My name is Butian Xiong. Currently, I am an AI engineer working at the Shenzhen Future Network Intelligence Institute and a research scientist at Infused AI. I also serve as a technical consultant at [Auki-Labs](https://www.aukilabs.com/), where I work closely with [Yatong Han](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=qO7xbbgAAAAJ). Previously, I worked as a research assistant at CUHK-SZ (Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen) in the Deep Bit Lab under the guidance of Professor [Zhen Li](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/lizhen/) on 3D representation. I also led a team in a point cloud scanning project at DJI. Prior to that, I worked at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology) in the Geometry AI Lab, guided by Professor [Minhyuk Sung](https://mhsung.github.io/). Before my internship at KAIST, I was supervised by Professor [Tin Lun Lam](https://sites.google.com/site/lamtinlun) and worked with Dr. [Liguang Zhou](https://sites.google.com/view/zhouliguang/home) on out-of-distribution problems at the Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Lab (RAIL) at CUHK-SZ. Additionally, I was supervised by Professor [Liu Li](https://liliu-avril.github.io/) at SRIBD (Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data), where I worked on 3D digital human generation.
