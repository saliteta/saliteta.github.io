My name is Butian Xiong, and I will begin my master's studies at the University of Southern California in Spring 2025. Previously, I worked as an AI engineer at the Shenzhen Future Network Intelligence Institute and as a research scientist at Infused AI, where I collaborated closely with [Yatong Han](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=qO7xbbgAAAAJ). Additionally, I also served as a technical consultant at [Auki-Labs](https://www.aukilabs.com/). Earlier in my career, I worked as a research assistant at CUHK-SZ (Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen) in the Deep Bit Lab under the guidance of Professor [Zhen Li](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/lizhen/) on 3D representation. Prior to that, I worked at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology) in the Geometry AI Lab, guided by Professor [Minhyuk Sung](https://mhsung.github.io/). Prior to my internship at KAIST, I was supervised by Professor [Tin Lun Lam](https://sites.google.com/site/lamtinlun) and worked with Dr. [Liguang Zhou](https://sites.google.com/view/zhouliguang/home) on out-of-distribution problems at the Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Lab (RAIL) at CUHK-SZ. Additionally, I was supervised by Professor [Liu Li](https://liliu-avril.github.io/) at SRIBD (Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data), where I worked on 3D digital human generation. Currently I am focusing on 3D scene understanding research including object manipulation, in-door navigation, large scale scene reconstruction and related topics.
