collection: publications
permalink: 
excerpt: 'We introduce a novel large-scale scene reconstruction benchmark using the newly developed 3D representation approach, Gaussian Splatting, on our expansive U-Scene dataset. U-Scene encompasses over one and a half square kilometres, featuring a comprehensive RGB dataset coupled with LiDAR ground truth. For data acquisition, we employed the Matrix 300 drone equipped with the high-accuracy Zenmuse L1 LiDAR, enabling precise rooftop data collection. This dataset, offers a unique blend of urban and academic environments for advanced spatial analysis convers more than 1.5 km2. Our evaluation of U-Scene with Gaussian Splatting includes a detailed analysis across various novel viewpoints. We also juxtapose these results with those derived from our accurate point cloud dataset, highlighting significant differences that underscore the importance of combine multi-modal information'

Image classification plays a pivotal role across diverse applications, yet challenges persist when models are deployed in real-world scenarios. Notably, these models falter in detecting unfamiliar classes that were not incorporated during classifier training, a formidable hurdle for safe and effective real-world model deployment, commonly known as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. While existing techniques, like max logits, aim to leverage logits for OOD identification, they often disregard the intricate interclass relationships that underlie effective detection. This paper presents an innovative class relevance learning method tailored for OOD detection. Our method establishes a comprehensive class relevance learning framework, strategically harnessing interclass relationships within the OOD pipeline. This framework significantly augments OOD detection capabilities. Extensive experimentation on diverse datasets, encompassing generic image classification datasets (Near OOD and Far OOD datasets), demonstrates the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art alternatives for OOD detection.
