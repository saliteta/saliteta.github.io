collection: publications
permalink: 
excerpt: 'We introduce a novel large-scale scene reconstruction benchmark using the newly developed 3D representation approach, Gaussian Splatting, on our expansive U-Scene dataset. U-Scene encompasses over one and a half square kilometres, featuring a comprehensive RGB dataset coupled with LiDAR ground truth. For data acquisition, we employed the Matrix 300 drone equipped with the high-accuracy Zenmuse L1 LiDAR, enabling precise rooftop data collection. This dataset, offers a unique blend of urban and academic environments for advanced spatial analysis convers more than 1.5 km2. Our evaluation of U-Scene with Gaussian Splatting includes a detailed analysis across various novel viewpoints. We also juxtapose these results with those derived from our accurate point cloud dataset, highlighting significant differences that underscore the importance of combine multi-modal information'
