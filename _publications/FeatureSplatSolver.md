excerpt: |
  We cast feature lifting onto splat-based 3D reps as a sparse linear inverse problem with a closed-form solution, plus two regularizers (Tikhonov Guidance, Post-Lifting Aggregation) to stabilize and denoise multi-view features. Delivers state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D segmentation in minutes.

We present a unified, kernel- and feature-agnostic formulation of feature lifting as a sparse linear inverse problemâ€¦ *(full text here if you want a longer page)*
