# About Me

My name is Butian Xiong. I am now working as a research assistant at CUHK-SZ(Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen) Deep Bit Lab guided by Professor [Zhen Li](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/lizhen/) on 3D representation. And I served as a team leader in DJI point cloud scanning project. Previous to that I worked in KAIST(Korea Advanced Institute & Tech) Geometry AI Lab guided by professor [Minhyuk](https://mhsung.github.io/). Before I joined as an intern at KAIST, I was under the supervision of Professor [Tin Lun Lam](https://sites.google.com/site/lamtinlun) and worked with Doctor [Liguang](https://sites.google.com/view/zhouliguang/home) and to deal with out-of-distribution problems at Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Lab(RAIL) at CUHK-SZ. I was supervised by Professor [Liu Li](https://liliu-avril.github.io/) in SRIBD (Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data) to deal with the 3D digital human generation problem. I have also had some experiences in robotics including drones and unmanned sailing boats.

I am currently looking for a PhD position in 3D model generation or binding on XR equipment. I also looking forward to solving a multi-modal problem that connects the skeleton model (graph) to human motion (video) or text-to-hand gesture (sign language). Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in me. One can check out my contact information at the bottom of this paper
